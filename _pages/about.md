I am a post-doc at Stanford University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), 
and I am advised by [Professor Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/) and [Professor Shuguang Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1o_qvR0AAAAJ&hl=en). 
I received Ph.D. degree and B.E. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2018 and 2013, respectively, 
and my Ph.D. advisor was [Professor Yuantao Gu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=FL61g6wAAAAJ). 
My research interests include optimization algorithms and applications in statistics, signal processing, and machine learning.
