I am a post-doc at Stanford University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), 
and I am advised by [Professor Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/) and [Professor Shuguang Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1o_qvR0AAAAJ&hl=en). 
I received Ph.D. degree and B.E. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2018 and 2013, respectively, 
and my Ph.D. advisor was [Professor Yuantao Gu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=FL61g6wAAAAJ). 
My research interests include optimization algorithms and applications in statistics, signal processing, and machine learning.

1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
